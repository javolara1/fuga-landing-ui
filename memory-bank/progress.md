# Progress

_This document tracks what works, what's left to build, the current status, known issues, and the evolution of project decisions._

## What Works

- Basic SvelteKit project setup with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
- Development environment configured (Vite, ESLint, Prettier).
- Testing framework set up (Vitest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E).
- Memory bank initialized and populated with project analysis.

## What's Left to Build

- Core UI components (buttons, inputs, navigation, etc.).
- Component library structure and organization.
- Comprehensive documentation and usage examples.
- Automated testing suite for components.
- Design system guidelines and theme configuration.
- Accessibility testing and compliance verification.

## Current Status

The project is in the early development stage. The foundation is set up with modern tooling, and the memory bank has been initialized to track project progress and decisions.

## Known Issues

- No known issues at this stage.
- Project is still in scaffolding phase.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- **Initial Setup:** Chose SvelteKit for its modern approach to building web applications with file-based routing.
- **Styling:** Selected Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling approach, providing flexibility and consistency.
- **TypeScript:** Adopted for type safety and better developer experience.
- **Testing:** Implemented both unit (Vitest) and E2E (Playwright) testing to ensure quality.
- **Memory Bank:** Established structured documentation system for maintaining project context across sessions.
