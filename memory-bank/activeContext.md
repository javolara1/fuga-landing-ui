# Active Context

_This document tracks the current work focus, recent changes, next steps, active decisions, important patterns, and project insights._

## Current Work Focus

- Initializing the memory bank and analyzing the project structure.
- Setting up the foundation for the UI component library.

## Recent Changes

- Created memory bank files: `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`.
- Analyzed `package.json` to understand dependencies and scripts.
- Examined project structure and routing setup.

## Next Steps

- Develop core UI components (buttons, forms, etc.).
- Set up component documentation and examples.
- Implement automated testing for components.
- Establish design system guidelines using Tailwind CSS.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- **Technology Stack:** Confirmed use of SvelteKit, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
- **Component Design:** Need to decide on component API design (props, events, etc.).
- **Accessibility:** Ensure all components meet WCAG guidelines.
- **Testing Strategy:** Balance between unit tests and E2E tests.

## Important Patterns and Preferences

- Use file-based routing with SvelteKit.
- Follow TypeScript best practices for type safety.
- Use Tailwind CSS for consistent styling.
- Maintain component modularity and reusability.

## Learnings and Project Insights

- The project is in its early stages with basic SvelteKit setup.
- Strong foundation with modern tooling (Vite, ESLint, Prettier).
- Opportunity to build a comprehensive component library from scratch.
